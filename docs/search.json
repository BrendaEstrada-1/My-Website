    "text": "Why the People Project?\nThe People Project exists to illuminate the value of every story, helping people live intentionally and share experiences that teach, inspire, and resonate. The idea first came to me while interviewing my mother for a performance I was choreographing. She said her story didn’t really matter and questioned its importance—but I don’t believe that. I believe everyone has the right to speak, to open up, and to heal in countless ways. I’m still exploring how to bring the People Project to life, because there are so many directions it could go. One thing is certain: I don’t just want to interview people. I want to immerse myself in their worlds, to connect with them on a deep, personal level. I want this project to be creatively challenging—mixing media, expressionism, poetry, dance, and more. I want to find new ways to share these lessons so they are truly felt, whether through short films, reels, or other forms of storytelling. Ultimately, I want the People Project to be a platform that reminds people of our shared humanity—the kindness of strangers, the innocent smiles of children, and the moments of connection that make life meaningful."
